README for cctbx_dev_docs chatbot generation

This chatbot uses NotebookLM and contains the CCTBX documentation and
all cctbx code. 

NOTE: To do the same for Phenix, follow the same procedure but use 
the Phenix code in your repository at <path_to_phenix_project> and
documentation from https://cci.lbl.gov/docs/phenix/.

The necessary code is in the phenix_project/Chat repository. First clone
or find that repository and use that path below where it 
says Chat.
 
To recreate it:

1. Point to the Chat repository and your copy of cctbx code:
setenv Chat <path-to-chat>
setenv cctbx <path_to_cctbx_project>


2.  Get the documentation in cctbx_docs.pdf:


mkdir cctbx_dev_docs
cd cctbx_dev_docs

cp $Chat/code/crawler.py .

python $Chat/crawler.py https://cci.lbl.gov/docs/cctbx/
cp discovered_urls.txt phenix_cctbx.list

Now go through each url in phenix_cctbx.list and download that page as a pdf
file.  Then combine all these pdf files to make cctbx_docs.pdf

3.  Get the code as a series of text files.

python  $Chat/code/cctbx_list.py $cctbx 300

That should result in a little under 300 .txt files.  If too many... adjust the parameter from 300 down to make it fewer.


Now upload the pdf and all the txt files and also info.txt to the LM and 
you are set.
